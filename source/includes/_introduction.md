# Introduction

For the Trident Migration project we are migrating design and content from the Kentico CMS that Trident is currently using to a Wordpress backend.
Follow this documentation to onboard to the project and run a local DEV instance of the files.

Note: Our DEV environement is using a **shared database** which means you need to be careful about content as it will affect everyone just like in Prod. 

The template changes, will be local, please use git to manage the code-portion of the project.
