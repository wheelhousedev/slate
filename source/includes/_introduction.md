# Introduction

This document is to support coverage while Dustin is out on Paternaty-Leave. On the whole this document should cover the who, what and when of all the active projects while I'm out. That said, a lot of what I do at Wheelhouse is answer questions. It will take a team effort to ensure not any one person is bearing the brunt of Q & A. Also, please reach out with any high risk issues or problems. I'd rather take time between diapers to answer questions rather than have everyone stuck because I forgot something. :-)

Here is a Quick list of the people you should check with First:

- CE Team

I recommend checking with Johnathn, Liz or Sheila as they often have context on all things, but below are the people who should be able to help.
