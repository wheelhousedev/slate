# Introduction

This document is to support coverage while Dustin is out on Paternaty-Leave. On the whole this document should cover the who, what and when of all the active projects while I'm out. That said, a lot of what I do at Wheelhouse is answer questions. It will take a team effort to ensure not any one person is bearing the brunt of Q & A. Also, please reach out with any high risk issues or problems. I'd rather take time between diapers to answer questions rather than have everyone stuck because I forgot something. :-)

Here is a Quick list of the people you should check with First:

**Authenticator**: My phone acts as MFA for the root account for __Biolife AWS__. You'll have to call/text for a code if you need Root access.

**Leave Dates**: 
- 04/16/2019 - 05/17/2019 I will be completely off (except for emergencies/interviews please)
- Week of 05/20/2019 I will be back half-time partly remote to get ack into the swing of things.
- Week of 05/27/2019 Back full-time.

**Person Quick-Reference**:

- CE Team
